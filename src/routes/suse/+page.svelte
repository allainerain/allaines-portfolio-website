    <p>
      Borrowing services at our university library is slow and frustrating â€” every request required manually filling out the same Google Forms over and over. For our software engineering class, my team built SUSe, a seamless borrowing and lending system designed to automate this process for students and librarians.

    <h3 class="pt-8 font-semibold">
        The problem: Library services were being managed through a patchwork of Google Forms and Sheets. This led to frequent errors on the admin side and a repetitive, frustrating experience for students.
    </h3>
    <p>We conducted interviews with both students and librarians to understand pain points in the current borrowing process. As students ourselves, we had firsthand experience with the system's shortcomings.</p>

    <p>Our team recognized the real-world potential of our solution. We proactively reached out to the Engineering Library, scheduled meetings, and pitched SUSe directly to librarians. Their enthusiasm confirmed we were solving a genuine problem.</p>

    <h3 class="pt-8 font-semibold">Leveraging a Colloquium for Customer Validation</h3>
    <p>We were invited to join our university's final-year project colloquium, despite being underclassmen. There, we presented our MVP and over 50 students provided feedback, with many expressing genuine interest in using SUSe if deployed in our library.</p>
    <p>While we went in with the intention to gather as much user feedback, we left with validation and a 2nd Runner Up prize.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Zarah, SUSe was able to secure a pilot test with the Engineering Library using real-world scenarios. This validated that SUSe could successfully operate outside the controlled classroom environment.</p>
    
    <!-- SECTION -->
    <h3 class="pt-8 font-semibold">New and improved SUSe</h3>
    <p>After our successful pilot, we refined the system over winter break, launching SUSe 2.0 with improved branding, smoother user flows, cleaner code, and enhanced authentication.</p>

    <p>SUSe is now fully integrated into the UP Engineering Library, actively serving over 700 students with more than 1,300 borrowing records to date. SUSe has also resulted in 50% reduction in lending processing time and achieved 94% user satisfaction.</p>

    <h3 class="pt-8 font-semibold">â‚±120K Grant & National Recognition</h3>
    <p>Using SUSe as a proof of concept, we successfully pitched Citrusâ€”a broader initiative to implement similar systems across other institutionsâ€”and secured â‚±120,000 in funding from the University of the Philippines. The project was also honored with the Gawad Pangulo: Natatanging Inobasyon ng Mag-aaral (Student Innovations Award), recognizing its impact and potential for broader adoption.</p>

    <h3 class="pt-8 font-semibold">The People You Work With Matter</h3>
    <p>This project wouldnâ€™t have come to life without the unwavering collaboration with my teammate, Zarah. Her passion and intensity matched mine every step of the way. We trusted each other deeply (with her leading the backend and me leading the frontend), and that mutual trust, paired with a shared drive to build something meaningful, is what pushed SUSe forward.</p>

    <h3 class="pt-8 font-semibold">Solve Problems That Matter to You</h3>
    <p>It sounds simple, but itâ€™s powerful: when you care about the problem, you care more about the solution. Being personally invested gave us a deeper motivation to keep going. After all, who better to solve a problem than someone who truly understands it?</p>
    
    <h3 class="pt-8 font-semibold">Donâ€™t Let Constraints Limit Your Vision</h3>
    <p>This could have stayed a class project, but we saw more. We chose to go beyond the brief, engaging real stakeholders, continuing work long after the semester ended, and deploying the platform in the real world. Believing in its potential is what made the difference.</p>
